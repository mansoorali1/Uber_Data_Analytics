# Uber_Data_Analytics
The goal of this project is to perform data analytics on Uber data using various tools and technologies, including GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio.
develop a complete data pipeline, guiding data from collection to insights through a series of structured stages.

-Extracted data, cleaned it and loaded into Google Cloud Storage for further processing.
-Transformed and modeled the data using fact and dimensional data modeling concepts using Python.
-Using ETL concept, orchestrated the data pipeline on Mage AI and loaded the transformed data into Google BigQuery.
-Developed a dashboard on Looker Studio.
