# Uber_Data_Analytics
The goal of this project is to develop a complete data pipeline, guiding data from collection to insights through a series of structured stages.
1. Extracted data, cleaned it and loaded into Google Cloud Storage for further processing.
2. Transformed and modeled the data using fact and dimensional data modeling concepts using Python.
3. Using ETL concept, orchestrated the data pipeline on Mage AI and loaded the transformed data into Google BigQuery.
4. Developed a dashboard on Looker Studio.
## Technology Used
1. Python
2. Google Storage
3. Compute Instance
4. BigQuery
5. Looker Studio
## Data
The data include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
